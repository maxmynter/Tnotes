# Tnotes
This is a MacOS notetaking app that I built for my girlfriend with Tauri, Rust, and Vanilla JS.

It has two main features:
- The background transparency is tuneable (which allows you to type notes in front of other tasks like videos, calls, or reference text)
- It allows easy export of a note to apple notes

On top, it supports Markdown formatting for the Notes export -- at least as far as Apple Notes supports Markdown mid 2025 (which sadly doesn't include checkboxes).

This is how it looks:
